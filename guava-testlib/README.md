## IMPORTANT WARNINGS

1. APIs marked with the `@Beta` annotation at the class or method level
are subject to change. They can be modified in any way, or even
removed, at any time. If your code is a library itself (i.e. it is
used on the CLASSPATH of users outside your own control), you should
not use beta APIs, unless you [repackage] them. **If your
code is a library, we strongly recommend using the [Guava Beta Checker] to
ensure that you do not use any `@Beta` APIs!**
