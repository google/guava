/**
 * An implementation of {@code Iterable} which throws an exception on all invocations of the {@link
 * #iterator()} method after the first, and whose iterator is always unmodifiable.
 *
 * <p>The {@code Iterable} specification does not make it absolutely clear what should happen on a
 * second invocation, so implementors have made various choices, including:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>returning the same iterator again
 *   <li>throwing an exception of some kind
 *   <li>or the usual, <i>robust</i> behavior, which all known {@link Collection} implementations
 *       have, of returning a new, independent iterator
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Because of this situation, any public method accepting an iterable should invoke the {@code
 * iterator} method only once, and should be tested using this class. Exceptions to this rule should
 * be clearly documented.
 *
 * <p>Note that although your APIs should be liberal in what they accept, your methods which
 * <i>return</i> iterables should make every attempt to return ones of the robust variety.
 *
 * <p>This testing utility is not thread-safe.
