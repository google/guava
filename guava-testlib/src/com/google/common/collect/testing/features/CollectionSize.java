/**
 * When describing the features of the collection produced by a given generator (i.e. in a call to
 * {@link
 * com.google.common.collect.testing.FeatureSpecificTestSuiteBuilder#withFeatures(Feature...)}),
 * this annotation specifies each of the different sizes for which a test suite should be built. (In
 * a typical case, the features should include {@link CollectionSize#ANY}.) These semantics are thus
 * a little different from those of other Collection-related features such as {@link
 * CollectionFeature} or {@link SetFeature}.
 *
 * <p>However, when {@link CollectionSize.Require} is used to annotate a test it behaves normally
 * (i.e. it requires the collection instance under test to be a certain size for the test to run).
 * Note that this means a test should not require more than one CollectionSize, since a particular
 * collection instance can only be one size at once.
