/**
 * A utility for testing an Iterator implementation by comparing its behavior to that of a "known
 * good" reference implementation. In order to accomplish this, it's important to test a great
 * variety of sequences of the {@link Iterator#next}, {@link Iterator#hasNext} and {@link
 * Iterator#remove} operations. This utility takes the brute-force approach of trying <i>all</i>
 * possible sequences of these operations, up to a given number of steps. So, if the caller
 * specifies to use <i>n</i> steps, a total of <i>3^n</i> tests are actually performed.
 *
 * <p>For instance, if <i>steps</i> is 5, one example sequence that will be tested is:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>remove();
 *   <li>hasNext()
 *   <li>hasNext();
 *   <li>remove();
 *   <li>next();
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>This particular order of operations may be unrealistic, and testing all 3^5 of them may be
 * thought of as overkill; however, it's difficult to determine which proper subset of this massive
 * set would be sufficient to expose any possible bug. Brute force is simpler.
 *
 * <p>To use this class the concrete subclass must implement the {@link
 * IteratorTester#newTargetIterator()} method. This is because it's impossible to test an Iterator
 * without changing its state, so the tester needs a steady supply of fresh Iterators.
 *
 * <p>If your iterator supports modification through {@code remove()}, you may wish to override the
 * verify() method, which is called <em>after</em> each sequence and is guaranteed to be called
 * using the latest values obtained from {@link IteratorTester#newTargetIterator()}.
 *
 * <p>The value you pass to the parameter {@code steps} should be greater than the length of your
 * iterator, so that this class can check that your iterator behaves correctly when it is exhausted.
 *
 * <p>For example, to test {@link java.util.Collections#unmodifiableList(java.util.List)
 * Collections.unmodifiableList}'s iterator:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * List<String> expectedElements =
 *     Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c", "d", "e");
 * List<String> actualElements =
 *     Collections.unmodifiableList(
 *         Arrays.asList("a", "b", "c", "d", "e"));
 * IteratorTester<String> iteratorTester =
 *     new IteratorTester<String>(
 *         6,
 *         IteratorFeature.UNMODIFIABLE,
 *         expectedElements,
 *         IteratorTester.KnownOrder.KNOWN_ORDER) {
 *       @Override
 *       protected Iterator<String> newTargetIterator() {
 *         return actualElements.iterator();
 *       }
 *     };
 * iteratorTester.test();
 * iteratorTester.testForEachRemaining();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Note</b>: It is necessary to use {@code IteratorTester.KnownOrder} as shown above, rather
 * than {@code KnownOrder} directly, because otherwise the code cannot be compiled.
