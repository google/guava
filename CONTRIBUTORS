Guava has mostly not used the CONTRIBUTORS file, instead relying on Git
history. You can see a summary of contributions at
https://github.com/google/guava/graphs/contributors. However, Git history
over-counts some people's contributions because they were responsible for
mirroring out changes from our internal repo.

This files serves mainly to credit people who have not received proper credit
in the Git history.

Doug Lea, author of some concurrency libraries

Joshua O'Madadhain (@jrtom), author of some common.graph commits beyond those
that are already attributed to him in the Git history:
