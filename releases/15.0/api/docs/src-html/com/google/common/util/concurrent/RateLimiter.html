<span class="sourceLineNo">029</span> * A rate limiter. Conceptually, a rate limiter distributes permits at a<a name="line.29"></a>

<span class="sourceLineNo">091</span>   * How is the RateLimiter designed, and why?<a name="line.91"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">092</span>   *<a name="line.92"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">093</span>   * The primary feature of a RateLimiter is its "stable rate", the maximum rate that<a name="line.93"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">094</span>   * is should allow at normal conditions. This is enforced by "throttling" incoming<a name="line.94"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">095</span>   * requests as needed, i.e. compute, for an incoming request, the appropriate throttle time,<a name="line.95"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">096</span>   * and make the calling thread wait as much.<a name="line.96"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">097</span>   *<a name="line.97"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">098</span>   * The simplest way to maintain a rate of QPS is to keep the timestamp of the last<a name="line.98"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">099</span>   * granted request, and ensure that (1/QPS) seconds have elapsed since then. For example,<a name="line.99"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">100</span>   * for a rate of QPS=5 (5 tokens per second), if we ensure that a request isn't granted<a name="line.100"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">101</span>   * earlier than 200ms after the the last one, then we achieve the intended rate.<a name="line.101"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">102</span>   * If a request comes and the last request was granted only 100ms ago, then we wait for<a name="line.102"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">103</span>   * another 100ms. At this rate, serving 15 fresh permits (i.e. for an acquire(15) request)<a name="line.103"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">104</span>   * naturally takes 3 seconds.<a name="line.104"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">105</span>   *<a name="line.105"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">106</span>   * It is important to realize that such a RateLimiter has a very superficial memory<a name="line.106"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">107</span>   * of the past: it only remembers the last request. What if the RateLimiter was unused for<a name="line.107"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">108</span>   * a long period of time, then a request arrived and was immediately granted?<a name="line.108"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">109</span>   * This RateLimiter would immediately forget about that past underutilization. This may<a name="line.109"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">110</span>   * result in either underutilization or overflow, depending on the real world consequences<a name="line.110"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">111</span>   * of not using the expected rate.<a name="line.111"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">112</span>   *<a name="line.112"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">113</span>   * Past underutilization could mean that excess resources are available. Then, the RateLimiter<a name="line.113"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">114</span>   * should speed up for a while, to take advantage of these resources. This is important<a name="line.114"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">115</span>   * when the rate is applied to networking (limiting bandwidth), where past underutilization<a name="line.115"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">116</span>   * typically translates to "almost empty buffers", which can be filled immediately.<a name="line.116"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">117</span>   *<a name="line.117"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">118</span>   * On the other hand, past underutilization could mean that "the server responsible for<a name="line.118"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">119</span>   * handling the request has become less ready for future requests", i.e. its caches become<a name="line.119"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">120</span>   * stale, and requests become more likely to trigger expensive operations (a more extreme<a name="line.120"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">121</span>   * case of this example is when a server has just booted, and it is mostly busy with getting<a name="line.121"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">122</span>   * itself up to speed).<a name="line.122"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">123</span>   *<a name="line.123"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">124</span>   * To deal with such scenarios, we add an extra dimension, that of "past underutilization",<a name="line.124"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">125</span>   * modeled by "storedPermits" variable. This variable is zero when there is no<a name="line.125"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">126</span>   * underutilization, and it can grow up to maxStoredPermits, for sufficiently large<a name="line.126"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">127</span>   * underutilization. So, the requested permits, by an invocation acquire(permits),<a name="line.127"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">128</span>   * are served from:<a name="line.128"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">129</span>   * - stored permits (if available)<a name="line.129"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">130</span>   * - fresh permits (for any remaining permits)<a name="line.130"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">131</span>   *<a name="line.131"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">132</span>   * How this works is best explained with an example:<a name="line.132"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">133</span>   *<a name="line.133"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">134</span>   * For a RateLimiter that produces 1 token per second, every second<a name="line.134"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">135</span>   * that goes by with the RateLimiter being unused, we increase storedPermits by 1.<a name="line.135"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">136</span>   * Say we leave the RateLimiter unused for 10 seconds (i.e., we expected a request at time<a name="line.136"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">137</span>   * X, but we are at time X + 10 seconds before a request actually arrives; this is<a name="line.137"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">138</span>   * also related to the point made in the last paragraph), thus storedPermits<a name="line.138"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">139</span>   * becomes 10.0 (assuming maxStoredPermits &gt;= 10.0). At that point, a request of acquire(3)<a name="line.139"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">140</span>   * arrives. We serve this request out of storedPermits, and reduce that to 7.0 (how this is<a name="line.140"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">141</span>   * translated to throttling time is discussed later). Immediately after, assume that an<a name="line.141"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">142</span>   * acquire(10) request arriving. We serve the request partly from storedPermits,<a name="line.142"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">143</span>   * using all the remaining 7.0 permits, and the remaining 3.0, we serve them by fresh permits<a name="line.143"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">144</span>   * produced by the rate limiter.<a name="line.144"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">145</span>   *<a name="line.145"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">146</span>   * We already know how much time it takes to serve 3 fresh permits: if the rate is<a name="line.146"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">147</span>   * "1 token per second", then this will take 3 seconds. But what does it mean to serve 7<a name="line.147"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">148</span>   * stored permits? As explained above, there is no unique answer. If we are primarily<a name="line.148"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">149</span>   * interested to deal with underutilization, then we want stored permits to be given out<a name="line.149"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">150</span>   * /faster/ than fresh ones, because underutilization = free resources for the taking.<a name="line.150"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">151</span>   * If we are primarily interested to deal with overflow, then stored permits could<a name="line.151"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">152</span>   * be given out /slower/ than fresh ones. Thus, we require a (different in each case)<a name="line.152"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">153</span>   * function that translates storedPermits to throtting time.<a name="line.153"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">154</span>   *<a name="line.154"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">155</span>   * This role is played by storedPermitsToWaitTime(double storedPermits, double permitsToTake).<a name="line.155"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">156</span>   * The underlying model is a continuous function mapping storedPermits<a name="line.156"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">157</span>   * (from 0.0 to maxStoredPermits) onto the 1/rate (i.e. intervals) that is effective at the given<a name="line.157"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">158</span>   * storedPermits. "storedPermits" essentially measure unused time; we spend unused time<a name="line.158"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">159</span>   * buying/storing permits. Rate is "permits / time", thus "1 / rate = time / permits".<a name="line.159"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">160</span>   * Thus, "1/rate" (time / permits) times "permits" gives time, i.e., integrals on this<a name="line.160"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">161</span>   * function (which is what storedPermitsToWaitTime() computes) correspond to minimum intervals<a name="line.161"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">162</span>   * between subsequent requests, for the specified number of requested permits.<a name="line.162"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">163</span>   *<a name="line.163"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">164</span>   * Here is an example of storedPermitsToWaitTime:<a name="line.164"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">165</span>   * If storedPermits == 10.0, and we want 3 permits, we take them from storedPermits,<a name="line.165"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">166</span>   * reducing them to 7.0, and compute the throttling for these as a call to<a name="line.166"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">167</span>   * storedPermitsToWaitTime(storedPermits = 10.0, permitsToTake = 3.0), which will<a name="line.167"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">168</span>   * evaluate the integral of the function from 7.0 to 10.0.<a name="line.168"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">169</span>   *<a name="line.169"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">170</span>   * Using integrals guarantees that the effect of a single acquire(3) is equivalent<a name="line.170"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">171</span>   * to { acquire(1); acquire(1); acquire(1); }, or { acquire(2); acquire(1); }, etc,<a name="line.171"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">172</span>   * since the integral of the function in [7.0, 10.0] is equivalent to the sum of the<a name="line.172"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">173</span>   * integrals of [7.0, 8.0], [8.0, 9.0], [9.0, 10.0] (and so on), no matter<a name="line.173"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">174</span>   * what the function is. This guarantees that we handle correctly requests of varying weight<a name="line.174"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">175</span>   * (permits), /no matter/ what the actual function is - so we can tweak the latter freely.<a name="line.175"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">176</span>   * (The only requirement, obviously, is that we can compute its integrals).<a name="line.176"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">177</span>   *<a name="line.177"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">178</span>   * Note well that if, for this function, we chose a horizontal line, at height of exactly<a name="line.178"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">179</span>   * (1/QPS), then the effect of the function is non-existent: we serve storedPermits at<a name="line.179"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">180</span>   * exactly the same cost as fresh ones (1/QPS is the cost for each). We use this trick later.<a name="line.180"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">181</span>   *<a name="line.181"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">182</span>   * If we pick a function that goes /below/ that horizontal line, it means that we reduce<a name="line.182"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">183</span>   * the area of the function, thus time. Thus, the RateLimiter becomes /faster/ after a<a name="line.183"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">184</span>   * period of underutilization. If, on the other hand, we pick a function that<a name="line.184"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">185</span>   * goes /above/ that horizontal line, then it means that the area (time) is increased,<a name="line.185"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">186</span>   * thus storedPermits are more costly than fresh permits, thus the RateLimiter becomes<a name="line.186"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">187</span>   * /slower/ after a period of underutilization.<a name="line.187"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">188</span>   *<a name="line.188"></a>

<span class="sourceLineNo">542</span>   * Before going into the details of this particular function, let's keep in mind the basics:<a name="line.542"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">543</span>   * 1) The state of the RateLimiter (storedPermits) is a vertical line in this figure.<a name="line.543"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">544</span>   * 2) When the RateLimiter is not used, this goes right (up to maxPermits)<a name="line.544"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">545</span>   * 3) When the RateLimiter is used, this goes left (down to zero), since if we have storedPermits,<a name="line.545"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">546</span>   *    we serve from those first<a name="line.546"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">547</span>   * 4) When _unused_, we go right at the same speed (rate)! I.e., if our rate is<a name="line.547"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">548</span>   *    2 permits per second, and 3 unused seconds pass, we will always save 6 permits<a name="line.548"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">549</span>   *    (no matter what our initial position was), up to maxPermits.<a name="line.549"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">550</span>   *    If we invert the rate, we get the "stableInterval" (interval between two requests<a name="line.550"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">551</span>   *    in a perfectly spaced out sequence of requests of the given rate). Thus, if you<a name="line.551"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">552</span>   *    want to see "how much time it will take to go from X storedPermits to X+K storedPermits?",<a name="line.552"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">553</span>   *    the answer is always stableInterval * K. In the same example, for 2 permits per second,<a name="line.553"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">554</span>   *    stableInterval is 500ms. Thus to go from X storedPermits to X+6 storedPermits, we<a name="line.554"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">555</span>   *    require 6 * 500ms = 3 seconds.<a name="line.555"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">556</span>   *<a name="line.556"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">557</span>   *    In short, the time it takes to move to the right (save K permits) is equal to the<a name="line.557"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">558</span>   *    rectangle of width == K and height == stableInterval.<a name="line.558"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">559</span>   * 4) When _used_, the time it takes, as explained in the introductory class note, is<a name="line.559"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">560</span>   *    equal to the integral of our function, between X permits and X-K permits, assuming<a name="line.560"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">561</span>   *    we want to spend K saved permits.<a name="line.561"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">562</span>   *<a name="line.562"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">563</span>   *    In summary, the time it takes to move to the left (spend K permits), is equal to the<a name="line.563"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">564</span>   *    area of the function of width == K.<a name="line.564"></a>

<span class="sourceLineNo">568</span>   * When we have storedPermits &lt;= halfPermits (the left portion of the function), then<a name="line.568"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">569</span>   * we spend them at the exact same rate that<a name="line.569"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">570</span>   * fresh permits would be generated anyway (that rate is 1/stableInterval). We size<a name="line.570"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">571</span>   * this area to be equal to _half_ the specified warmup period. Why we need this?<a name="line.571"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">572</span>   * And why half? We'll explain shortly below (after explaining the second part).<a name="line.572"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">573</span>   *<a name="line.573"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">574</span>   * Stored permits that are beyond halfPermits, are mapped to an ascending line, that goes<a name="line.574"></a>

<span class="sourceLineNo">576</span>   * 2 * stableInterval, and is sized appropriately to have an area _equal_ to the<a name="line.576"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">577</span>   * specified warmup period. Thus, by point (4) above, it takes "warmupPeriod" amount of time<a name="line.577"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">578</span>   * to go from maxPermits to halfPermits.<a name="line.578"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">579</span>   *<a name="line.579"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">580</span>   * BUT, by point (3) above, it only takes "warmupPeriod / 2" amount of time to return back<a name="line.580"></a>
<span class="sourceLineNo">581</span>   * to maxPermits, from halfPermits! (Because the trapezoid has double the area of the rectangle<a name="line.581"></a>
