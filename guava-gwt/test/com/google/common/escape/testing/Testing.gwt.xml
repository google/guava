    We used to set this only for packages that had manual supersource. That
    worked everywhere that I know of except for one place: when running the GWT
    util.concurrent tests under Guava.

    The problem is that GWT responds poorly to two .gwt.xml files in the same
    Java package; see
    https://groups.google.com/g/google-web-toolkit-contributors/c/CqYH59Dt_rQ/m/uVGW1QdUsXUJ
    for details.

    The summary is that it ignores one file in favor of the other.
    util.concurrent, like nearly all our packages, has two .gwt.xml files: one
    for prod and one for tests. However, unlike our other packages, as of this
    writing it has test supersource but no prod supersource.

    GWT happens to use the prod .gwt.xml, so it looks for no supersource for
    tests, either. This causes it to fail to find AtomicLongMapTest.

    Our workaround is to tell GWT that util.concurrent and all other packages
    have prod supersource, even if they have none. GWT is happy to ignore us
    when we specify a nonexistent path.

    (I hope that this workaround does not cause its own problems in the future.)
