/**
 * A synchronization abstraction supporting waiting on arbitrary boolean conditions.
 *
 * <p>This class is intended as a replacement for {@link ReentrantLock}. Code using {@code Monitor}
 * is less error-prone and more readable than code using {@code ReentrantLock}, without significant
 * performance loss. {@code Monitor} even has the potential for performance gain by optimizing the
 * evaluation and signaling of conditions. Signaling is entirely <a
 * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(synchronization)#Implicit_signaling">implicit</a>. By
 * eliminating explicit signaling, this class can guarantee that only one thread is awakened when a
 * condition becomes true (no "signaling storms" due to use of {@link
 * java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition#signalAll Condition.signalAll}) and that no signals are lost
 * (no "hangs" due to incorrect use of {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition#signal
 * Condition.signal}).
 *
 * <p>A thread is said to <i>occupy</i> a monitor if it has <i>entered</i> the monitor but not yet
 * <i>left</i>. Only one thread may occupy a given monitor at any moment. A monitor is also
 * reentrant, so a thread may enter a monitor any number of times, and then must leave the same
 * number of times. The <i>enter</i> and <i>leave</i> operations have the same synchronization
 * semantics as the built-in Java language synchronization primitives.
 *
 * <p>A call to any of the <i>enter</i> methods with <b>void</b> return type should always be
 * followed immediately by a <i>try/finally</i> block to ensure that the current thread leaves the
 * monitor cleanly:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * monitor.enter();
 * try {
 *   // do things while occupying the monitor
 * } finally {
 *   monitor.leave();
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>A call to any of the <i>enter</i> methods with <b>boolean</b> return type should always appear
 * as the condition of an <i>if</i> statement containing a <i>try/finally</i> block to ensure that
 * the current thread leaves the monitor cleanly:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * if (monitor.tryEnter()) {
 *   try {
 *     // do things while occupying the monitor
 *   } finally {
 *     monitor.leave();
 *   }
 * } else {
 *   // do other things since the monitor was not available
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Comparison with {@code synchronized} and {@code ReentrantLock}</h2>
 *
 * <p>The following examples show a simple threadsafe holder expressed using {@code synchronized},
 * {@link ReentrantLock}, and {@code Monitor}.
 *
 * <h3>{@code synchronized}</h3>
 *
 * <p>This version is the fewest lines of code, largely because the synchronization mechanism used
 * is built into the language and runtime. But the programmer has to remember to avoid a couple of
 * common bugs: The {@code wait()} must be inside a {@code while} instead of an {@code if}, and
 * {@code notifyAll()} must be used instead of {@code notify()} because there are two different
 * logical conditions being awaited.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class SafeBox<V> {
 *   private V value;
 *
 *   public synchronized V get() throws InterruptedException {
 *     while (value == null) {
 *       wait();
 *     }
 *     V result = value;
 *     value = null;
 *     notifyAll();
 *     return result;
 *   }
 *
 *   public synchronized void set(V newValue) throws InterruptedException {
 *     while (value != null) {
 *       wait();
 *     }
 *     value = newValue;
 *     notifyAll();
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h3>{@code ReentrantLock}</h3>
 *
 * <p>This version is much more verbose than the {@code synchronized} version, and still suffers
 * from the need for the programmer to remember to use {@code while} instead of {@code if}. However,
 * one advantage is that we can introduce two separate {@code Condition} objects, which allows us to
 * use {@code signal()} instead of {@code signalAll()}, which may be a performance benefit.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class SafeBox<V> {
 *   private V value;
 *   private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
 *   private final Condition valuePresent = lock.newCondition();
 *   private final Condition valueAbsent = lock.newCondition();
 *
 *   public V get() throws InterruptedException {
 *     lock.lock();
 *     try {
 *       while (value == null) {
 *         valuePresent.await();
 *       }
 *       V result = value;
 *       value = null;
 *       valueAbsent.signal();
 *       return result;
 *     } finally {
 *       lock.unlock();
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   public void set(V newValue) throws InterruptedException {
 *     lock.lock();
 *     try {
 *       while (value != null) {
 *         valueAbsent.await();
 *       }
 *       value = newValue;
 *       valuePresent.signal();
 *     } finally {
 *       lock.unlock();
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h3>{@code Monitor}</h3>
 *
 * <p>This version adds some verbosity around the {@code Guard} objects, but removes that same
 * verbosity, and more, from the {@code get} and {@code set} methods. {@code Monitor} implements the
 * same efficient signaling as we had to hand-code in the {@code ReentrantLock} version above.
 * Finally, the programmer no longer has to hand-code the wait loop, and therefore doesn't have to
 * remember to use {@code while} instead of {@code if}.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class SafeBox<V> {
 *   private V value;
 *   private final Monitor monitor = new Monitor();
 *   private final Monitor.Guard valuePresent = monitor.newGuard(() -> value != null);
 *   private final Monitor.Guard valueAbsent = monitor.newGuard(() -> value == null);
 *
 *   public V get() throws InterruptedException {
 *     monitor.enterWhen(valuePresent);
 *     try {
 *       V result = value;
 *       value = null;
 *       return result;
 *     } finally {
 *       monitor.leave();
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   public void set(V newValue) throws InterruptedException {
 *     monitor.enterWhen(valueAbsent);
 *     try {
 *       value = newValue;
 *     } finally {
 *       monitor.leave();
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>

  // Here are Justin's design notes about this:
  //
  // This idea has come up from time to time, and I think one of my
  // earlier versions of Monitor even did something like this. I ended
  // up strongly favoring the current interface.
  //
  // I probably can't remember all the reasons (it's possible you
  // could find them in the code review archives), but here are a few:
  //
  // 1. What about leaving/unlocking? Are you going to do
  //    guard.enter() paired with monitor.leave()? That might get
  //    confusing. It's nice for the finally block to look as close as
  //    possible to the thing right before the try. You could have
  //    guard.leave(), but that's a little odd as well because the
  //    guard doesn't have anything to do with leaving. You can't
  //    really enforce that the guard you're leaving is the same one
  //    you entered with, and it doesn't actually matter.
  //
  // 2. Since you can enter the monitor without a guard at all, some
  //    places you'll have monitor.enter()/monitor.leave() and other
  //    places you'll have guard.enter()/guard.leave() even though
  //    it's the same lock being acquired underneath. Always using
  //    monitor.enterXXX()/monitor.leave() will make it really clear
  //    which lock is held at any point in the code.
  //
  // 3. I think "enterWhen(notEmpty)" reads better than "notEmpty.enter()".
  //
  // TODO(user): Implement ReentrantLock features:
  //    - toString() method
  //    - getOwner() method
  //    - getQueuedThreads() method
  //    - getWaitingThreads(Guard) method
  //    - implement Serializable
  //    - redo the API to be as close to identical to ReentrantLock as possible,
  //      since, after all, this class is also a reentrant mutual exclusion lock!?

  /*
   * One of the key challenges of this class is to prevent lost signals, while trying hard to
   * minimize unnecessary signals. One simple and correct algorithm is to signal some other waiter
   * with a satisfied guard (if one exists) whenever any thread occupying the monitor exits the
   * monitor, either by unlocking all of its held locks, or by starting to wait for a guard. This
   * includes exceptional exits, so all control paths involving signalling must be protected by a
   * finally block.
   *
   * Further optimizations of this algorithm become increasingly subtle. A wait that terminates
   * without the guard being satisfied (due to timeout, but not interrupt) can then immediately exit
   * the monitor without signalling. If it timed out without being signalled, it does not need to
   * "pass on" the signal to another thread. If it *was* signalled, then its guard must have been
   * satisfied at the time of signal, and has since been modified by some other thread to be
   * non-satisfied before reacquiring the lock, and that other thread takes over the responsibility
   * of signaling the next waiter.
   *
   * Unlike the underlying Condition, if we are not careful, an interrupt *can* cause a signal to be
   * lost, because the signal may be sent to a condition whose sole waiter has just been
   * interrupted.
   *
   * Imagine a monitor with multiple guards. A thread enters the monitor, satisfies all the guards,
   * and leaves, calling signalNextWaiter. With traditional locks and conditions, all the conditions
   * need to be signalled because it is not known which if any of them have waiters (and hasWaiters
   * can't be used reliably because of a check-then-act race). With our Monitor guards, we only
   * signal the first active guard that is satisfied. But the corresponding thread may have already
   * been interrupted and is waiting to reacquire the lock while still registered in activeGuards,
   * in which case the signal is a no-op, and the bigger-picture signal is lost unless interrupted
   * threads take special action by participating in the signal-passing game.
   */

  /*
   * Timeout handling is intricate, especially given our ambitious goals:
   * - Avoid underflow and overflow of timeout values when specified timeouts are close to
   *   Long.MIN_VALUE or Long.MAX_VALUE.
   * - Favor responding to interrupts over timeouts.
   * - System.nanoTime() is expensive enough that we want to call it the minimum required number of
   *   times, typically once before invoking a blocking method. This often requires keeping track of
   *   the first time in a method that nanoTime() has been invoked, for which the special value 0L
   *   is reserved to mean "uninitialized". If timeout is non-positive, then nanoTime need never be
   *   called.
   * - Keep behavior of fair and non-fair instances consistent.
