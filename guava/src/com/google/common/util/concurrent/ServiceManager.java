/**
 * A manager for monitoring and controlling a set of {@linkplain Service services}. This class
 * provides methods for {@linkplain #startAsync() starting}, {@linkplain #stopAsync() stopping} and
 * {@linkplain #servicesByState inspecting} a collection of {@linkplain Service services}.
 * Additionally, users can monitor state transitions with the {@linkplain Listener listener}
 * mechanism.
 *
 * <p>While it is recommended that service lifecycles be managed via this class, state transitions
 * initiated via other mechanisms do not impact the correctness of its methods. For example, if the
 * services are started by some mechanism besides {@link #startAsync}, the listeners will be invoked
 * when appropriate and {@link #awaitHealthy} will still work as expected.
 *
 * <p>Here is a simple example of how to use a {@code ServiceManager} to start a server.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * class Server {
 *   public static void main(String[] args) {
 *     Set<Service> services = ...;
 *     ServiceManager manager = new ServiceManager(services);
 *     manager.addListener(new Listener() {
 *         public void stopped() {}
 *         public void healthy() {
 *           // Services have been initialized and are healthy, start accepting requests...
 *         }
 *         public void failure(Service service) {
 *           // Something failed, at this point we could log it, notify a load balancer, or take
 *           // some other action.  For now we will just exit.
 *           System.exit(1);
 *         }
 *       },
 *       MoreExecutors.directExecutor());
 *
 *     Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread() {
 *       public void run() {
 *         // Give the services 5 seconds to stop to ensure that we are responsive to shutdown
 *         // requests.
 *         try {
 *           manager.stopAsync().awaitStopped(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
 *         } catch (TimeoutException timeout) {
 *           // stopping timed out
 *         }
 *       }
 *     });
 *     manager.startAsync();  // start all the services asynchronously
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>This class uses the ServiceManager's methods to start all of its services, to respond to
 * service failure and to ensure that when the JVM is shutting down all the services are stopped.
