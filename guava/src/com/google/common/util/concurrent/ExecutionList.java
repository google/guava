/**
 * A support class for {@code ListenableFuture} implementations to manage their listeners. An

 * that every {@code Runnable} that is {@linkplain #add added} will be executed after {@link
 * #execute()} is called. Any {@code Runnable} added after the call to {@code execute} is still
 * guaranteed to execute. There is no guarantee, however, that listeners will be executed in the
 * order that they are added.
 *
 * <p>Exceptions thrown by a listener will be propagated up to the executor. Any exception thrown
 * during {@code Executor.execute} (e.g., a {@code RejectedExecutionException} or an exception
 * thrown by {@linkplain MoreExecutors#directExecutor direct execution}) will be caught and logged.
