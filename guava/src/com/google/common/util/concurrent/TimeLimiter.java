   * the caller when the timeout elapses; aborting the target method call is of secondary concern.

   * implementation-dependent. However, it is important that each of the methods on the target
   * object behaves appropriately when its thread is interrupted.
   *
   * <p>For example, to return the value of {@code target.someMethod()}, but substitute {@code

   * <pre>
