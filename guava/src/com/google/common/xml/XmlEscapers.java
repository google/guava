/**
 * {@code Escaper} instances suitable for strings to be included in XML attribute values and
 * elements' text contents. When possible, avoid manual escaping by using templating systems and
 * high-level APIs that provide autoescaping. For example, consider <a
 * href="http://www.xom.nu/">XOM</a> or <a href="http://www.jdom.org/">JDOM</a>.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> Currently the escapers provided by this class do not escape any characters
 * outside the ASCII character range. Unlike HTML escaping the XML escapers will not escape
 * non-ASCII characters to their numeric entity replacements. These XML escapers provide the minimal
 * level of escaping to ensure that the output can be safely included in a Unicode XML document.
 *
 * <p>For details on the behavior of the escapers in this class, see sections <a
 * href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/#charsets">2.2</a> and <a
 * href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/#syntax">2.4</a> of the XML specification.
