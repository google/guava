/**
 * Legacy version of {@link java.util.function.Function java.util.function.Function}.
 *
 * <p>The {@link Functions} class provides common functions and related utilities.
 *
 * <p>As this interface extends {@code java.util.function.Function}, an instance of this type can be
 * used as a {@code java.util.function.Function} directly. To use a {@code
 * java.util.function.Function} in a context where a {@code com.google.common.base.Function} is
 * needed, use {@code function::apply}.
 *
 * <p>This interface is now a legacy type. Use {@code java.util.function.Function} (or the
 * appropriate primitive specialization such as {@code ToIntFunction}) instead whenever possible.
 * Otherwise, at least reduce <i>explicit</i> dependencies on this type by using lambda expressions
 * or method references instead of classes, leaving your code easier to migrate in the future.
 *
 * <p>See the Guava User Guide article on <a
 * href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/FunctionalExplained">the use of {@code Function}</a>.
