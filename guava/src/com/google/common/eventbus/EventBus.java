/**
 * Dispatches events to listeners, and provides ways for listeners to register themselves.

 *
 * <h2>Avoid EventBus</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>We recommend against using EventBus.</b> It was designed many years ago, and newer
 * libraries offer better ways to decouple components and react to events.
 *
 * <p>To decouple components, we recommend a dependency-injection framework. For Android code, most
 * apps use <a href="https://dagger.dev">Dagger</a>. For server code, common options include <a
 * href="https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/Motivation">Guice</a> and <a
 * href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html#beans-introduction">Spring</a>.
 * Frameworks typically offer a way to register multiple listeners independently and then request
 * them together as a set (<a href="https://dagger.dev/dev-guide/multibindings">Dagger</a>, <a
 * href="https://github.com/google/guice/wiki/Multibindings">Guice</a>, <a
 * href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html#beans-autowired-annotation">Spring</a>).
 *
 * <p>To react to events, we recommend a reactive-streams framework like <a
 * href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki">RxJava</a> (supplemented with its <a
 * href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid">RxAndroid</a> extension if you are building for
 * Android) or <a href="https://projectreactor.io/">Project Reactor</a>. (For the basics of
 * translating code from using an event bus to using a reactive-streams framework, see these two
 * guides: <a href="https://blog.jkl.gg/implementing-an-event-bus-with-rxjava-rxbus/">1</a>, <a
 * href="https://lorentzos.com/rxjava-as-event-bus-the-right-way-10a36bdd49ba">2</a>.) Some usages
 * of EventBus may be better written using <a
 * href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-guide.html">Kotlin coroutines</a>, including <a
 * href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html">Flow</a> and <a
 * href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/channels.html">Channels</a>. Yet other usages are better served
 * by individual libraries that provide specialized support for particular use cases.
 *
 * <p>Disadvantages of EventBus include:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>It makes the cross-references between producer and subscriber harder to find. This can
 *       complicate debugging, lead to unintentional reentrant calls, and force apps to eagerly
 *       initialize all possible subscribers at startup time.
 *   <li>It uses reflection in ways that break when code is processed by optimizers/minimizers like
 *       <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code">R8 and Proguard</a>.
 *   <li>It doesn't offer a way to wait for multiple events before taking action. For example, it
 *       doesn't offer a way to wait for multiple producers to all report that they're "ready," nor
 *       does it offer a way to batch multiple events from a single producer together.
 *   <li>It doesn't support backpressure and other features needed for resilience.
 *   <li>It doesn't provide much control of threading.
 *   <li>It doesn't offer much monitoring.
 *   <li>It doesn't propagate exceptions, so apps don't have a way to react to them.
 *   <li>It doesn't interoperate well with RxJava, coroutines, and other more commonly used
 *       alternatives.
 *   <li>It imposes requirements on the lifecycle of its subscribers. For example, if an event
 *       occurs between when one subscriber is removed and the next subscriber is added, the event
 *       is dropped.
 *   <li>Its performance is suboptimal, especially under Android.
 *   <li>It <a href="https://github.com/google/guava/issues/1431">doesn't support parameterized
 *       types</a>.
 *   <li>With the introduction of lambdas in Java 8, EventBus went from less verbose than listeners
 *       to <a href="https://github.com/google/guava/issues/3311">more verbose</a>.
 * </ul>
 *

 *
 * <h2>EventBus Summary</h2>
 *
 * <p>The EventBus allows publish-subscribe-style communication between components without requiring
 * the components to explicitly register with one another (and thus be aware of each other). It is
 * designed exclusively to replace traditional Java in-process event distribution using explicit
 * registration. It is <em>not</em> a general-purpose publish-subscribe system, nor is it intended
 * for interprocess communication.
 *
 * <h2>Receiving Events</h2>
 *
 * <p>To receive events, an object should:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Expose a public method, known as the <i>event subscriber</i>, which accepts a single
 *       argument of the type of event desired;
 *   <li>Mark it with a {@link Subscribe} annotation;
 *   <li>Pass itself to an EventBus instance's {@link #register(Object)} method.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Posting Events</h2>
 *
 * <p>To post an event, simply provide the event object to the {@link #post(Object)} method. The
 * EventBus instance will determine the type of event and route it to all registered listeners.
 *
 * <p>Events are routed based on their type &mdash; an event will be delivered to any subscriber for
 * any type to which the event is <em>assignable.</em> This includes implemented interfaces, all
 * superclasses, and all interfaces implemented by superclasses.
 *
 * <p>When {@code post} is called, all registered subscribers for an event are run in sequence, so
 * subscribers should be reasonably quick. If an event may trigger an extended process (such as a
 * database load), spawn a thread or queue it for later. (For a convenient way to do this, use an
 * {@link AsyncEventBus}.)
 *
 * <h2>Subscriber Methods</h2>
 *
 * <p>Event subscriber methods must accept only one argument: the event.
 *
 * <p>Subscribers should not, in general, throw. If they do, the EventBus will catch and log the
 * exception. This is rarely the right solution for error handling and should not be relied upon; it
 * is intended solely to help find problems during development.
 *
 * <p>The EventBus guarantees that it will not call a subscriber method from multiple threads
 * simultaneously, unless the method explicitly allows it by bearing the {@link
 * AllowConcurrentEvents} annotation. If this annotation is not present, subscriber methods need not
 * worry about being reentrant, unless also called from outside the EventBus.
 *
 * <h2>Dead Events</h2>
 *
 * <p>If an event is posted, but no registered subscribers can accept it, it is considered "dead."
 * To give the system a second chance to handle dead events, they are wrapped in an instance of
 * {@link DeadEvent} and reposted.
 *
 * <p>If a subscriber for a supertype of all events (such as Object) is registered, no event will
 * ever be considered dead, and no DeadEvents will be generated. Accordingly, while DeadEvent
 * extends {@link Object}, a subscriber registered to receive any Object will never receive a
 * DeadEvent.
 *
 * <p>This class is safe for concurrent use.
 *
 * <p>See the Guava User Guide article on <a
 * href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained">{@code EventBus}</a>.
