    // 1. Subscribers to events posted on different threads can be interleaved with each other
    //    freely. (A event on one thread, B event on another could yield any of
    //    [a1, a2, a3, b1, b2], [a1, b2, a2, a3, b2], [a1, b2, b3, a2, a3], etc.)
    // 2. It's possible for subscribers to actually be dispatched to in a different order than they
    //    were added to the queue. It's easily possible for one thread to take the head of the
    //    queue, immediately followed by another thread taking the next element in the queue. That
    //    second thread can then dispatch to the subscriber it took before the first thread does.
    //
    // All this makes me really wonder if there's any value in queueing here at all. A dispatcher
    // that simply loops through the subscribers and dispatches the event to each would actually
    // probably provide a stronger order guarantee, though that order would obviously be different
    // in some cases.
