/**
 * A readable source of characters, such as a text file. Unlike a {@link Reader}, a {@code
 * CharSource} is not an open, stateful stream of characters that can be read and closed. Instead,
 * it is an immutable <i>supplier</i> of {@code Reader} instances.
 *
 * <p>{@code CharSource} provides two kinds of methods:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Methods that return a reader:</b> These methods should return a <i>new</i>, independent
 *       instance each time they are called. The caller is responsible for ensuring that the
 *       returned reader is closed.
 *   <li><b>Convenience methods:</b> These are implementations of common operations that are
 *       typically implemented by opening a reader using one of the methods in the first category,
 *       doing something and finally closing the reader that was opened.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Several methods in this class, such as {@link #readLines()}, break the contents of the source
 * into lines. Like {@link BufferedReader}, these methods break lines on any of {@code \n}, {@code
 * \r} or {@code \r\n}, do not include the line separator in each line and do not consider there to
 * be an empty line at the end if the contents are terminated with a line separator.
 *
 * <p>Any {@link ByteSource} containing text encoded with a specific {@linkplain Charset character
 * encoding} may be viewed as a {@code CharSource} using {@link ByteSource#asCharSource(Charset)}.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> In general, {@code CharSource} is intended to be used for "file-like" sources
 * that provide readers that are:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Finite:</b> Many operations, such as {@link #length()} and {@link #read()}, will either
 *       block indefinitely or fail if the source creates an infinite reader.
 *   <li><b>Non-destructive:</b> A <i>destructive</i> reader will consume or otherwise alter the
 *       source as they are read from it. A source that provides such readers will not be reusable,
 *       and operations that read from the stream (including {@link #length()}, in some
 *       implementations) will prevent further operations from completing as expected.
 * </ul>
