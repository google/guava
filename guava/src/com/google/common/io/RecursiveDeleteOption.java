   * <p><b>Warning:</b> On a file system that supports symbolic links, it is possible for an
   * insecure recursive delete to delete files and directories that are <i>outside</i> the directory
   * being deleted. This can happen if, after checking that a file is a directory (and not a
   * symbolic link), that directory is deleted and replaced by a symbolic link to an outside
   * directory before the call that opens the directory to read its entries. File systems that
   * support {@code SecureDirectoryStream} do not have this vulnerability.
