/**
 * A destination to which bytes can be written, such as a file. Unlike an {@link OutputStream}, a
 * {@code ByteSink} is not an open, stateful stream that can be written to and closed. Instead, it
 * is an immutable <i>supplier</i> of {@code OutputStream} instances.
 *
 * <p>{@code ByteSink} provides two kinds of methods:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Methods that return a stream:</b> These methods should return a <i>new</i>, independent
 *       instance each time they are called. The caller is responsible for ensuring that the
 *       returned stream is closed.
 *   <li><b>Convenience methods:</b> These are implementations of common operations that are
 *       typically implemented by opening a stream using one of the methods in the first category,
 *       doing something and finally closing the stream or channel that was opened.
 * </ul>
