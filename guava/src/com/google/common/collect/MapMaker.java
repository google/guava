/**
 * A builder of {@link ConcurrentMap} instances that can have keys or values automatically wrapped
 * in {@linkplain WeakReference weak} references.
 *
 * <p>Usage example:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * ConcurrentMap<Request, Stopwatch> timers = new MapMaker()
 *     .concurrencyLevel(4)
 *     .weakKeys()
 *     .makeMap();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>These features are all optional; {@code new MapMaker().makeMap()} returns a valid concurrent
 * map that behaves similarly to a {@link ConcurrentHashMap}.
 *
 * <p>The returned map is implemented as a hash table with similar performance characteristics to
 * {@link ConcurrentHashMap}. It supports all optional operations of the {@code ConcurrentMap}
 * interface. It does not permit null keys or values.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> by default, the returned map uses equality comparisons (the {@link Object#equals
 * equals} method) to determine equality for keys or values. However, if {@link #weakKeys} was
 * specified, the map uses identity ({@code ==}) comparisons instead for keys. Likewise, if {@link
 * #weakValues} was specified, the map uses identity comparisons for values.
 *
 * <p>The view collections of the returned map have <i>weakly consistent iterators</i>. This means
 * that they are safe for concurrent use, but if other threads modify the map after the iterator is
 * created, it is undefined which of these changes, if any, are reflected in that iterator. These
 * iterators never throw {@link ConcurrentModificationException}.
 *
 * <p>If {@link #weakKeys} or {@link #weakValues} are requested, it is possible for a key or value
 * present in the map to be reclaimed by the garbage collector. Entries with reclaimed keys or
 * values may be removed from the map on each map modification or on occasional map accesses; such
 * entries may be counted by {@link Map#size}, but will never be visible to read or write
 * operations. A partially-reclaimed entry is never exposed to the user. Any {@link Map.Entry}
 * instance retrieved from the map's {@linkplain Map#entrySet entry set} is a snapshot of that
 * entry's state at the time of retrieval; such entries do, however, support {@link
 * Map.Entry#setValue}, which simply calls {@link Map#put} on the entry's key.
 *
 * <p>The maps produced by {@code MapMaker} are serializable, and the deserialized maps retain all
 * the configuration properties of the original map. During deserialization, if the original map had
 * used weak references, the entries are reconstructed as they were, but it's not unlikely they'll
 * be quickly garbage-collected before they are ever accessed.
 *
 * <p>{@code new MapMaker().weakKeys().makeMap()} is a recommended replacement for {@link
 * java.util.WeakHashMap}, but note that it compares keys using object identity whereas {@code
 * WeakHashMap} uses {@link Object#equals}.
