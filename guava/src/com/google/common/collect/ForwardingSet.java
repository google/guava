/**
 * A set which forwards all its method calls to another set. Subclasses should override one or more
 * methods to modify the behavior of the backing set as desired per the <a
 * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern">decorator pattern</a>.
 *
 * <p><b>Warning:</b> The methods of {@code ForwardingSet} forward <b>indiscriminately</b> to the
 * methods of the delegate. For example, overriding {@link #add} alone <b>will not</b> change the
 * behavior of {@link #addAll}, which can lead to unexpected behavior. In this case, you should
 * override {@code addAll} as well, either providing your own implementation, or delegating to the
 * provided {@code standardAddAll} method.
 *
 * <p><b>{@code default} method warning:</b> This class does <i>not</i> forward calls to {@code
 * default} methods. Instead, it inherits their default implementations. When those implementations
 * invoke methods, they invoke methods on the {@code ForwardingSet}.
 *
 * <p>The {@code standard} methods are not guaranteed to be thread-safe, even when all of the
 * methods that they depend on are thread-safe.
