/**
 * Provides a fluent API for calculating <a
 * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile">quantiles</a>.
 *
 * <h3>Examples</h3>
 *
 * <p>To compute the median:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * double myMedian = median().compute(myDataset);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * where {@link #median()} has been statically imported.
 *
 * <p>To compute the 99th percentile:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * double myPercentile99 = percentiles().index(99).compute(myDataset);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * where {@link #percentiles()} has been statically imported.
 *
 * <p>To compute median and the 90th and 99th percentiles:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * Map<Integer, Double> myPercentiles =
 *     percentiles().indexes(50, 90, 99).compute(myDataset);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * where {@link #percentiles()} has been statically imported: {@code myPercentiles} maps the keys
 * 50, 90, and 99, to their corresponding quantile values.
 *
 * <p>To compute quartiles, use {@link #quartiles()} instead of {@link #percentiles()}. To compute
 * arbitrary q-quantiles, use {@link #scale scale(q)}.
 *
 * <p>These examples all take a copy of your dataset. If you have a double array, you are okay with
 * it being arbitrarily reordered, and you want to avoid that copy, you can use {@code
 * computeInPlace} instead of {@code compute}.
 *
 * <h3>Definition and notes on interpolation</h3>
 *
 * <p>The definition of the kth q-quantile of N values is as follows: define x = k * (N - 1) / q; if
 * x is an integer, the result is the value which would appear at index x in the sorted dataset
 * (unless there are {@link Double#NaN NaN} values, see below); otherwise, the result is the average
 * of the values which would appear at the indexes floor(x) and ceil(x) weighted by (1-frac(x)) and
 * frac(x) respectively. This is the same definition as used by Excel and by S, it is the Type 7
 * definition in <a
 * href="http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/quantile.html">R</a>, and it is
 * described by <a
 * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile#Estimating_the_quantiles_of_a_population">
 * wikipedia</a> as providing "Linear interpolation of the modes for the order statistics for the
 * uniform distribution on [0,1]."
 *
 * <h3>Handling of non-finite values</h3>
 *
 * <p>If any values in the input are {@link Double#NaN NaN} then all values returned are {@link
 * Double#NaN NaN}. (This is the one occasion when the behaviour is not the same as you'd get from
 * sorting with {@link java.util.Arrays#sort(double[]) Arrays.sort(double[])} or {@link
 * java.util.Collections#sort(java.util.List) Collections.sort(List&lt;Double&gt;)} and selecting
 * the required value(s). Those methods would sort {@link Double#NaN NaN} as if it is greater than
 * any other value and place them at the end of the dataset, even after {@link
 * Double#POSITIVE_INFINITY POSITIVE_INFINITY}.)
 *
 * <p>Otherwise, {@link Double#NEGATIVE_INFINITY NEGATIVE_INFINITY} and {@link
 * Double#POSITIVE_INFINITY POSITIVE_INFINITY} sort to the beginning and the end of the dataset, as
 * you would expect.
 *
 * <p>If required to do a weighted average between an infinity and a finite value, or between an
 * infinite value and itself, the infinite value is returned. If required to do a weighted average
 * between {@link Double#NEGATIVE_INFINITY NEGATIVE_INFINITY} and {@link Double#POSITIVE_INFINITY
 * POSITIVE_INFINITY}, {@link Double#NaN NaN} is returned (note that this will only happen if the
 * dataset contains no finite values).
 *
 * <h3>Performance</h3>
 *
 * <p>The average time complexity of the computation is O(N) in the size of the dataset. There is a
 * worst case time complexity of O(N^2). You are extremely unlikely to hit this quadratic case on
 * randomly ordered data (the probability decreases faster than exponentially in N), but if you are
 * passing in unsanitized user data then a malicious user could force it. A light shuffle of the
 * data using an unpredictable seed should normally be enough to thwart this attack.
 *
 * <p>The time taken to compute multiple quantiles on the same dataset using {@link Scale#indexes
 * indexes} is generally less than the total time taken to compute each of them separately, and
 * sometimes much less. For example, on a large enough dataset, computing the 90th and 99th
 * percentiles together takes about 55% as long as computing them separately.
 *
 * <p>When calling {@link ScaleAndIndex#compute} (in {@linkplain ScaleAndIndexes#compute either
 * form}), the memory requirement is 8*N bytes for the copy of the dataset plus an overhead which is
 * independent of N (but depends on the quantiles being computed). When calling {@link
 * ScaleAndIndex#computeInPlace computeInPlace} (in {@linkplain ScaleAndIndexes#computeInPlace
 * either form}), only the overhead is required. The number of object allocations is independent of
 * N in both cases.
