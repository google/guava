/**
 * A map, each entry of which maps a {@link TypeToken} to an instance of that type. In addition to
 * implementing {@code Map}, the additional type-safe operations {@link #putInstance} and {@link
 * #getInstance} are available.
 *
 * <p>Generally, implementations don't support {@link #put} and {@link #putAll} because there is no
 * way to check an object at runtime to be an instance of a {@link TypeToken}. Instead, caller
 * should use the type safe {@link #putInstance}.
 *
 * <p>Also, if caller suppresses unchecked warnings and passes in an {@code Iterable<String>} for
 * type {@code Iterable<Integer>}, the map won't be able to detect and throw type error.
 *
 * <p>Like any other {@code Map<Class, Object>}, this map may contain entries for primitive types,
 * and a primitive type and its corresponding wrapper type may map to different values.
 *
 * @param <B> the common supertype that all entries must share; often this is simply {@link Object}
