/**
 * A function from {@code A} to {@code B} with an associated <i>reverse</i> function from {@code B}
 * to {@code A}; used for converting back and forth between <i>different representations of the same
 * information</i>.
 *
 * <h3>Invertibility</h3>
 *
 * <p>The reverse operation <b>may</b> be a strict <i>inverse</i> (meaning that {@code
 * converter.reverse().convert(converter.convert(a)).equals(a)} is always true). However, it is very
 * common (perhaps <i>more</i> common) for round-trip conversion to be <i>lossy</i>. Consider an
 * example round-trip using {@link com.google.common.primitives.Doubles#stringConverter}:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@code stringConverter().convert("1.00")} returns the {@code Double} value {@code 1.0}
 *   <li>{@code stringConverter().reverse().convert(1.0)} returns the string {@code "1.0"} --
 *       <i>not</i> the same string ({@code "1.00"}) we started with
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Note that it should still be the case that the round-tripped and original objects are
 * <i>similar</i>.
 *
 * <h3>Nullability</h3>
 *
 * <p>A converter always converts {@code null} to {@code null} and non-null references to non-null
 * references. It would not make sense to consider {@code null} and a non-null reference to be
 * "different representations of the same information", since one is distinguishable from
 * <i>missing</i> information and the other is not. The {@link #convert} method handles this null
 * behavior for all converters; implementations of {@link #doForward} and {@link #doBackward} are
 * guaranteed to never be passed {@code null}, and must never return {@code null}.
 *
 * <h3>Common ways to use</h3>
 *
 * <p>Getting a converter:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Use a provided converter implementation, such as {@link Enums#stringConverter}, {@link
 *       com.google.common.primitives.Ints#stringConverter Ints.stringConverter} or the {@linkplain
 *       #reverse reverse} views of these.
 *   <li>Convert between specific preset values using {@link
 *       com.google.common.collect.Maps#asConverter Maps.asConverter}. For example, use this to
 *       create a "fake" converter for a unit test. It is unnecessary (and confusing) to <i>mock</i>
 *       the {@code Converter} type using a mocking framework.
 *   <li>Extend this class and implement its {@link #doForward} and {@link #doBackward} methods.
 *   <li><b>Java 8+ users:</b> you may prefer to pass two lambda expressions or method references to
 *       the {@link #from from} factory method.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Using a converter:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Convert one instance in the "forward" direction using {@code converter.convert(a)}.
 *   <li>Convert multiple instances "forward" using {@code converter.convertAll(as)}.
 *   <li>Convert in the "backward" direction using {@code converter.reverse().convert(b)} or {@code
 *       converter.reverse().convertAll(bs)}.
 *   <li>Use {@code converter} or {@code converter.reverse()} anywhere a {@link
 *       java.util.function.Function} is accepted (for example {@link java.util.stream.Stream#map
 *       Stream.map}).
 *   <li><b>Do not</b> call {@link #doForward} or {@link #doBackward} directly; these exist only to
 *       be overridden.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Example</h3>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   return new Converter&lt;Integer, String&gt;() {
 *     protected String doForward(Integer i) {
 *       return Integer.toHexString(i);
 *     }
 *
 *     protected Integer doBackward(String s) {
 *       return parseUnsignedInt(s, 16);
 *     }
 *   };</pre>
 *
 * <p>An alternative using Java 8:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * return Converter.from(
 *     Integer::toHexString,
 *     s -> parseUnsignedInt(s, 16));
 * }</pre>

 * 1. The type parameter is <T> rather than <T extends @Nullable> so that we can use T in the

 * advantage of that for convertAll, as discussed on that method.)
 *
 * 2. The supertype of this class could be `Function<@Nullable A, @Nullable B>`, since
 * Converter.apply (like Converter.convert) is capable of accepting null inputs. However, a
 * supertype of `Function<A, B>` turns out to be massively more useful to callers in practice: They
 * want their output to be non-null in operations like `stream.map(myConverter)`, and we can
 * guarantee that as long as we also require the input type to be non-null[*] (which is a
 * requirement that existing callers already fulfill).
 *
 * Disclaimer: Part of the reason that callers are so well adapted to `Function<A, B>` may be that
 * that is how the signature looked even prior to this comment! So naturally any change can break
 * existing users, but it can't *fix* existing users because any users who needed
 * `Function<@Nullable A, @Nullable B>` already had to find a workaround. Still, there is a *ton* of
