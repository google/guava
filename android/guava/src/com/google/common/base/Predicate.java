/**
 * Determines a true or false value for a given input; a pre-Java-8 version of {@link
 * java.util.function.Predicate java.util.function.Predicate}.
 *
 * <p>The {@link Predicates} class provides common predicates and related utilities.
 *
 * <p>See the Guava User Guide article on <a
 * href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/FunctionalExplained">the use of {@code Predicate}</a>.
 *
 * <h3>For Java 8+ users</h3>
 *
 * <p>This interface is now a legacy type. Use {@code java.util.function.Predicate} (or the
 * appropriate primitive specialization such as {@code IntPredicate}) instead whenever possible.
 * Otherwise, at least reduce <i>explicit</i> dependencies on this type by using lambda expressions
 * or method references instead of classes, leaving your code easier to migrate in the future.
 *
 * <p>To use a reference of this type (say, named {@code guavaPredicate}) in a context where {@code
 * java.util.function.Predicate} is expected, use the method reference {@code
 * guavaPredicate::apply}. For the other direction, use {@code javaUtilPredicate::test}. A future
 * version of this interface will be made to <i>extend</i> {@code java.util.function.Predicate}, so
 * that conversion will be necessary in only one direction. At that time, this interface will be
 * officially discouraged.
