   * href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#application-x-www-form-urlencoded-percent-encode-set">URL
   * form parameter names and values</a>. Escaping is performed with the UTF-8 character encoding.

   * <p>When escaping a String, the following rules apply:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>The alphanumeric characters "a" through "z", "A" through "Z" and "0" through "9" remain
   *       the same.
   *   <li>The special characters ".", "-", "*", and "_" remain the same.
   *   <li>The space character " " is converted into a plus sign "+".
   *   <li>All other characters are converted into one or more bytes using UTF-8 encoding and each
   *       byte is then represented by the 3-character string "%XY", where "XY" is the two-digit,
   *       uppercase, hexadecimal representation of the byte value.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>This escaper is suitable for escaping parameter names and values even when <a
   * href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/appendix/notes.html#h-B.2.2">using the non-standard
   * semicolon</a>, rather than the ampersand, as a parameter delimiter. Nevertheless, we recommend
   * using the ampersand unless you must interoperate with systems that require semicolons.
   *
   * <p><b>Note:</b> Unlike other escapers, URL escapers produce <a
   * href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#percent-encode">uppercase</a> hexadecimal sequences.

   * characters unescaped, they would be escaped by the consumer at parse time, anyway.</a>)
   * Additionally, the escaper escapes the slash character ("/"). While slashes are acceptable in
