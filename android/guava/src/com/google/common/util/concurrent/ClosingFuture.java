/**
 * A step in a pipeline of an asynchronous computation. When the last step in the computation is
 * complete, some objects captured during the computation are closed.
 *
 * <p>A pipeline of {@code ClosingFuture}s is a tree of steps. Each step represents either an
 * asynchronously-computed intermediate value, or else an exception that indicates the failure or
 * cancellation of the operation so far. The only way to extract the value or exception from a step
 * is by declaring that step to be the last step of the pipeline. Nevertheless, we refer to the
 * "value" of a successful step or the "result" (value or exception) of any step.
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>A pipeline starts at its leaf step (or steps), which is created from either a callable
 *       block or a {@link ListenableFuture}.
 *   <li>Each other step is derived from one or more input steps. At each step, zero or more objects
 *       can be captured for later closing.
 *   <li>There is one last step (the root of the tree), from which you can extract the final result
 *       of the computation. After that result is available (or the computation fails), all objects
 *       captured by any of the steps in the pipeline are closed.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h3>Starting a pipeline</h3>
 *
 * Start a {@code ClosingFuture} pipeline {@linkplain #submit(ClosingCallable, Executor) from a
 * callable block} that may capture objects for later closing. To start a pipeline from a {@link
 * ListenableFuture} that doesn't create resources that should be closed later, you can use {@link
 * #from(ListenableFuture)} instead.
 *
 * <h3>Derived steps</h3>
 *
 * A {@code ClosingFuture} step can be derived from one or more input {@code ClosingFuture} steps in
 * ways similar to {@link FluentFuture}s:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>by transforming the value from a successful input step,
 *   <li>by catching the exception from a failed input step, or
 *   <li>by combining the results of several input steps.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Each derivation can capture the next value or any intermediate objects for later closing.
 *
 * <p>A step can be the input to at most one derived step. Once you transform its value, catch its
 * exception, or combine it with others, you cannot do anything else with it, including declare it
 * to be the last step of the pipeline.
 *
 * <h4>Transforming</h4>
 *
 * To derive the next step by asynchronously applying a function to an input step's value, call
 * {@link #transform(ClosingFunction, Executor)} or {@link #transformAsync(AsyncClosingFunction,
 * Executor)} on the input step.
 *
 * <h4>Catching</h4>
 *
 * To derive the next step from a failed input step, call {@link #catching(Class, ClosingFunction,
 * Executor)} or {@link #catchingAsync(Class, AsyncClosingFunction, Executor)} on the input step.
 *
 * <h4>Combining</h4>
 *
 * To derive a {@code ClosingFuture} from two or more input steps, pass the input steps to {@link
 * #whenAllComplete(Iterable)} or {@link #whenAllSucceed(Iterable)} or its overloads.
 *
 * <h3>Cancelling</h3>
 *
 * Any step in a pipeline can be {@linkplain #cancel(boolean) cancelled}, even after another step
 * has been derived, with the same semantics as cancelling a {@link Future}. In addition, a
 * successfully cancelled step will immediately start closing all objects captured for later closing
 * by it and by its input steps.
 *
 * <h3>Ending a pipeline</h3>
 *
 * Each {@code ClosingFuture} pipeline must be ended. To end a pipeline, decide whether you want to
 * close the captured objects automatically or manually.
 *
 * <h4>Automatically closing</h4>
 *
 * You can extract a {@link Future} that represents the result of the last step in the pipeline by
 * calling {@link #finishToFuture()}. All objects the pipeline has captured for closing will begin
 * to be closed asynchronously <b>after</b> the returned {@code Future} is done: the future
 * completes before closing starts, rather than once it has finished.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * FluentFuture<UserName> userName =
 *     ClosingFuture.submit(
 *             closer -> closer.eventuallyClose(database.newTransaction(), closingExecutor),
 *             executor)
 *         .transformAsync((closer, transaction) -> transaction.queryClosingFuture("..."), executor)
 *         .transform((closer, result) -> result.get("userName"), directExecutor())
 *         .catching(DBException.class, e -> "no user", directExecutor())
 *         .finishToFuture();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * In this example, when the {@code userName} {@link Future} is done, the transaction and the query
 * result cursor will both be closed, even if the operation is cancelled or fails.
 *
 * <h4>Manually closing</h4>
 *
 * If you want to close the captured objects manually, after you've used the final result, call
 * {@link #finishToValueAndCloser(ValueAndCloserConsumer, Executor)} to get an object that holds the
 * final result. You then call {@link ValueAndCloser#closeAsync()} to close the captured objects.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 *     ClosingFuture.submit(
 *             closer -> closer.eventuallyClose(database.newTransaction(), closingExecutor),
 *             executor)
 *     .transformAsync((closer, transaction) -> transaction.queryClosingFuture("..."), executor)
 *     .transform((closer, result) -> result.get("userName"), directExecutor())
 *     .catching(DBException.class, e -> "no user", directExecutor())
 *     .finishToValueAndCloser(
 *         valueAndCloser -> this.userNameValueAndCloser = valueAndCloser, executor);
 *
 * // later
 * try { // get() will throw if the operation failed or was cancelled.
 *   UserName userName = userNameValueAndCloser.get();
 *   // do something with userName
 * } finally {
 *   userNameValueAndCloser.closeAsync();
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * In this example, when {@code userNameValueAndCloser.closeAsync()} is called, the transaction and
 * the query result cursor will both be closed, even if the operation is cancelled or fails.
 *
 * <p>Note that if you don't call {@code closeAsync()}, the captured objects will not be closed. The
 * automatic-closing approach described above is safer.
 *
 * @param <V> the type of the value of this step
 * @since 30.0
