   *

   *
   * <p>The implementation deviates from the {@code ExecutorService} specification with regards to

   * implemented as "no-effort". No interrupts or other attempts are made to stop threads executing
   * tasks. Second, the returned list will always be empty, as any submitted task is considered to
   * have started execution. This applies also to tasks given to {@code invokeAll} or {@code
   * invokeAny} which are pending serial execution, even the subset of the tasks that have not yet
   * started execution. It is unclear from the {@code ExecutorService} specification if these should
   * be included, and it's much easier to implement the interpretation that they not be. Finally, a
   * call to {@code shutdown} or {@code shutdownNow} may result in concurrent calls to {@code
   * invokeAll/invokeAny} throwing RejectedExecutionException, although a subset of the tasks may
   * already have been executed.

  /**
   * Returns an {@link Executor} that runs each task in the thread that invokes {@link
   * Executor#execute execute}, as in {@code ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy}.
   *
   * <p>This executor is appropriate for tasks that are lightweight and not deeply chained.
   * Inappropriate {@code directExecutor} usage can cause problems, and these problems can be
   * difficult to reproduce because they depend on timing. For example:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>When a {@code ListenableFuture} listener is registered to run under {@code
   *       directExecutor}, the listener can execute in any of three possible threads:
   *       <ol>
   *         <li>When a thread attaches a listener to a {@code ListenableFuture} that's already
   *             complete, the listener runs immediately in that thread.
   *         <li>When a thread attaches a listener to a {@code ListenableFuture} that's
   *             <em>in</em>complete and the {@code ListenableFuture} later completes normally, the
   *             listener runs in the thread that completes the {@code ListenableFuture}.
   *         <li>When a listener is attached to a {@code ListenableFuture} and the {@code
   *             ListenableFuture} gets cancelled, the listener runs immediately in the thread that
   *             cancelled the {@code Future}.
   *       </ol>
   *       Given all these possibilities, it is frequently possible for listeners to execute in UI
   *       threads, RPC network threads, or other latency-sensitive threads. In those cases, slow
   *       listeners can harm responsiveness, slow the system as a whole, or worse. (See also the
   *       note about locking below.)
   *   <li>If many tasks will be triggered by the same event, one heavyweight task may delay other
   *       tasks -- even tasks that are not themselves {@code directExecutor} tasks.
   *   <li>If many such tasks are chained together (such as with {@code
   *       future.transform(...).transform(...).transform(...)....}), they may overflow the stack.
   *       (In simple cases, callers can avoid this by registering all tasks with the same {@link
   *       MoreExecutors#newSequentialExecutor} wrapper around {@code directExecutor()}. More
   *       complex cases may require using thread pools or making deeper changes.)
   *   <li>If an exception propagates out of a {@code Runnable}, it is not necessarily seen by any
   *       {@code UncaughtExceptionHandler} for the thread. For example, if the callback passed to
   *       {@link Futures#addCallback} throws an exception, that exception will be typically be
   *       logged by the {@link ListenableFuture} implementation, even if the thread is configured
   *       to do something different. In other cases, no code will catch the exception, and it may
   *       terminate whichever thread happens to trigger the execution.
   * </ul>
   *
   * A specific warning about locking: Code that executes user-supplied tasks, such as {@code
   * ListenableFuture} listeners, should take care not to do so while holding a lock. Additionally,
   * as a further line of defense, prefer not to perform any locking inside a task that will be run
   * under {@code directExecutor}: Not only might the wait for a lock be long, but if the running
   * thread was holding a lock, the listener may deadlock or break lock isolation.
   *
   * <p>This instance is equivalent to:
   *
   * <pre>{@code
   * final class DirectExecutor implements Executor {
   *   public void execute(Runnable r) {
   *     r.run();
   *   }
   * }
   * }</pre>
   *
   * <p>This should be preferred to {@link #newDirectExecutorService()} because implementing the
   * {@link ExecutorService} subinterface necessitates significant performance overhead.

   * Java Language Specification. Tasks execute with the same happens-before order that the function
   * calls to {@link Executor#execute execute()} that submitted those tasks had.
   *
   * <p>The executor uses {@code delegate} in order to {@link Executor#execute execute} each task in
   * turn, and does not create any threads of its own.
   *
   * <p>After execution begins on a thread from the {@code delegate} {@link Executor}, tasks are
   * polled and executed from a task queue until there are no more tasks. The thread will not be
   * released until there are no more tasks to run.
   *
   * <p>If a task is submitted while a thread is executing tasks from the task queue, the thread
   * will not be released until that submitted task is also complete.
   *
   * <p>If a task is {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted} while a task is running:
   *
   * <ol>
   *   <li>execution will not stop until the task queue is empty.
   *   <li>tasks will begin execution with the thread marked as not interrupted - any interruption
   *       applies only to the task that was running at the point of interruption.
   *   <li>if the thread was interrupted before the SequentialExecutor's worker begins execution,
   *       the interrupt will be restored to the thread after it completes so that its {@code
   *       delegate} Executor may process the interrupt.
   *   <li>subtasks are run with the thread uninterrupted and interrupts received during execution
   *       of a task are ignored.
   * </ol>
   *
   * <p>{@code RuntimeException}s thrown by tasks are simply logged and the executor keeps trucking.
   * If an {@code Error} is thrown, the error will propagate and execution will stop until the next
   * time a task is submitted.
   *
   * <p>When an {@code Error} is thrown by an executed task, previously submitted tasks may never
   * run. An attempt will be made to restart execution on the next call to {@code execute}. If the
