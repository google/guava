/**
 * An abstract implementation of {@link ListenableFuture}, intended for advanced users only. More
 * common ways to create a {@code ListenableFuture} include instantiating a {@link SettableFuture},
 * submitting a task to a {@link ListeningExecutorService}, and deriving a {@code Future} from an
 * existing one, typically using methods like {@link Futures#transform(ListenableFuture,
 * com.google.common.base.Function, java.util.concurrent.Executor) Futures.transform} and {@link
 * Futures#catching(ListenableFuture, Class, com.google.common.base.Function,
 * java.util.concurrent.Executor) Futures.catching}.
 *
 * <p>This class implements all methods in {@code ListenableFuture}. Subclasses should provide a way
 * to set the result of the computation through the protected methods {@link #set(Object)}, {@link
 * #setFuture(ListenableFuture)} and {@link #setException(Throwable)}. Subclasses may also override
 * {@link #afterDone()}, which will be invoked automatically when the future completes. Subclasses
 * should rarely override other methods.
