/**
 * An object with an operational state, plus asynchronous {@link #startAsync()} and {@link
 * #stopAsync()} lifecycle methods to transition between states. Example services include
 * webservers, RPC servers and timers.
 *
 * <p>The normal lifecycle of a service is:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@linkplain State#NEW NEW} -&gt;
 *   <li>{@linkplain State#STARTING STARTING} -&gt;
 *   <li>{@linkplain State#RUNNING RUNNING} -&gt;
 *   <li>{@linkplain State#STOPPING STOPPING} -&gt;
 *   <li>{@linkplain State#TERMINATED TERMINATED}
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>There are deviations from this if there are failures or if {@link Service#stopAsync} is called
 * before the {@link Service} reaches the {@linkplain State#RUNNING RUNNING} state. The set of legal
 * transitions form a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">DAG</a>,
 * therefore every method of the listener will be called at most once. N.B. The {@link State#FAILED}
 * and {@link State#TERMINATED} states are terminal states, once a service enters either of these
 * states it cannot ever leave them.
 *
 * <p>Implementors of this interface are strongly encouraged to extend one of the abstract classes
 * in this package which implement this interface and make the threading and state management
 * easier.
