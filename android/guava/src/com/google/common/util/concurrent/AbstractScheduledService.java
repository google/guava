/**
 * Base class for services that can implement {@link #startUp} and {@link #shutDown} but while in
 * the "running" state need to perform a periodic task. Subclasses can implement {@link #startUp},
 * {@link #shutDown} and also a {@link #runOneIteration} method that will be executed periodically.
 *
 * <p>This class uses the {@link ScheduledExecutorService} returned from {@link #executor} to run
 * the {@link #startUp} and {@link #shutDown} methods and also uses that service to schedule the
 * {@link #runOneIteration} that will be executed periodically as specified by its {@link
 * Scheduler}. When this service is asked to stop via {@link #stopAsync} it will cancel the periodic
 * task (but not interrupt it) and wait for it to stop before running the {@link #shutDown} method.
 *
 * <p>Subclasses are guaranteed that the life cycle methods ({@link #runOneIteration}, {@link
 * #startUp} and {@link #shutDown}) will never run concurrently. Notably, if any execution of {@link
 * #runOneIteration} takes longer than its schedule defines, then subsequent executions may start
 * late. Also, all life cycle methods are executed with a lock held, so subclasses can safely modify
 * shared state without additional synchronization necessary for visibility to later executions of
 * the life cycle methods.
 *
 * <h3>Usage Example</h3>
 *
 * <p>Here is a sketch of a service which crawls a website and uses the scheduling capabilities to
 * rate limit itself.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * class CrawlingService extends AbstractScheduledService {
 *   private Set<Uri> visited;
 *   private Queue<Uri> toCrawl;
 *   protected void startUp() throws Exception {
 *     toCrawl = readStartingUris();
 *   }
 *
 *   protected void runOneIteration() throws Exception {
 *     Uri uri = toCrawl.remove();
 *     Collection<Uri> newUris = crawl(uri);
 *     visited.add(uri);
 *     for (Uri newUri : newUris) {
 *       if (!visited.contains(newUri)) { toCrawl.add(newUri); }
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   protected void shutDown() throws Exception {
 *     saveUris(toCrawl);
 *   }
 *
 *   protected Scheduler scheduler() {
 *     return Scheduler.newFixedRateSchedule(0, 1, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>This class uses the life cycle methods to read in a list of starting URIs and save the set of
 * outstanding URIs when shutting down. Also, it takes advantage of the scheduling functionality to
 * rate limit the number of queries we perform.
