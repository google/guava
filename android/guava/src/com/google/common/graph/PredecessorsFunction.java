/**
 * A functional interface for <a
 * href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">graph</a>-structured data.
 *
 * <p>This interface is meant to be used as the type of a parameter to graph algorithms (such as
 * topological sort) that only need a way of accessing the predecessors of a node in a graph.
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 *
 * Given an algorithm, for example:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public <N> someGraphAlgorithm(N startNode, PredecessorsFunction<N> predecessorsFunction);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * you will invoke it depending on the graph representation you're using.
 *
 * <p>If you have an instance of one of the primary {@code common.graph} types ({@link Graph},
 * {@link ValueGraph}, and {@link Network}):
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * someGraphAlgorithm(startNode, graph);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * This works because those types each implement {@code PredecessorsFunction}. It will also work
 * with any other implementation of this interface.
 *
 * <p>If you have your own graph implementation based around a custom node type {@code MyNode},
 * which has a method {@code getParents()} that retrieves its predecessors in a graph:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * someGraphAlgorithm(startNode, MyNode::getParents);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>If you have some other mechanism for returning the predecessors of a node, or one that doesn't
 * return a {@code Iterable<? extends N>}, then you can use a lambda to perform a more general
 * transformation:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * someGraphAlgorithm(startNode, node -> ImmutableList.of(node.mother(), node.father()));
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Graph algorithms that need additional capabilities (accessing both predecessors and
 * successors, iterating over the edges, etc.) should declare their input to be of a type that
 * provides those capabilities, such as {@link Graph}, {@link ValueGraph}, or {@link Network}.
 *
 * <h3>Additional documentation</h3>
 *
 * <p>See the Guava User Guide for the {@code common.graph} package (<a
 * href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained">"Graphs Explained"</a>) for
 * additional documentation, including <a
 * href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/GraphsExplained#notes-for-implementors">notes for
 * implementors</a>
