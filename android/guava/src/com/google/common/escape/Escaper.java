/**
 * An object that converts literal text into a format safe for inclusion in a particular context
 * (such as an XML document). Typically (but not always), the inverse process of "unescaping" the
 * text is performed automatically by the relevant parser.
 *
 * <p>For example, an XML escaper would convert the literal string {@code "Foo<Bar>"} into {@code
 * "Foo&lt;Bar&gt;"} to prevent {@code "<Bar>"} from being confused with an XML tag. When the
 * resulting XML document is parsed, the parser API will return this text as the original literal
 * string {@code "Foo<Bar>"}.
 *
 * <p>An {@code Escaper} instance is required to be stateless, and safe when used concurrently by
 * multiple threads.
 *
 * <p>Because, in general, escaping operates on the code points of a string and not on its
 * individual {@code char} values, it is not safe to assume that {@code escape(s)} is equivalent to
 * {@code escape(s.substring(0, n)) + escape(s.substring(n))} for arbitrary {@code n}. This is
 * because of the possibility of splitting a surrogate pair. The only case in which it is safe to
 * escape strings and concatenate the results is if you can rule out this possibility, either by
 * splitting an existing long string into short strings adaptively around {@linkplain
 * Character#isHighSurrogate surrogate} {@linkplain Character#isLowSurrogate pairs}, or by starting
 * with short strings already known to be free of unpaired surrogates.
 *
 * <p>The two primary implementations of this interface are {@link CharEscaper} and {@link
 * UnicodeEscaper}. They are heavily optimized for performance and greatly simplify the task of
 * implementing new escapers. It is strongly recommended that when implementing a new escaper you
 * extend one of these classes. If you find that you are unable to achieve the desired behavior
 * using either of these classes, please contact the Java libraries team for advice.
 *
 * <p>Popular escapers are defined as constants in classes like {@link
 * com.google.common.html.HtmlEscapers} and {@link com.google.common.xml.XmlEscapers}. To create
 * your own escapers, use {@link CharEscaperBuilder}, or extend {@code CharEscaper} or {@code
 * UnicodeEscaper}.
