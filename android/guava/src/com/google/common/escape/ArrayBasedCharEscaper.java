/**
 * A {@link CharEscaper} that uses an array to quickly look up replacement characters for a given
 * {@code char} value. An additional safe range is provided that determines whether {@code char}
 * values without specific replacements are to be considered safe and left unescaped or should be
 * escaped in a general way.
 *
 * <p>A good example of usage of this class is for Java source code escaping where the replacement
 * array contains information about special ASCII characters such as {@code \\t} and {@code \\n}
 * while {@link #escapeUnsafe} is overridden to handle general escaping of the form {@code \\uxxxx}.
 *
 * <p>The size of the data structure used by {@link ArrayBasedCharEscaper} is proportional to the
 * highest valued character that requires escaping. For example a replacement map containing the
 * single character '{@code \}{@code u1000}' will require approximately 16K of memory. If you need
 * to create multiple escaper instances that have the same character replacement mapping consider
 * using {@link ArrayBasedEscaperMap}.
