/**
 * An object that converts literal text into a format safe for inclusion in a particular context
 * (such as an XML document). Typically (but not always), the inverse process of "unescaping" the
 * text is performed automatically by the relevant parser.
 *
 * <p>For example, an XML escaper would convert the literal string {@code "Foo<Bar>"} into {@code
 * "Foo&lt;Bar&gt;"} to prevent {@code "<Bar>"} from being confused with an XML tag. When the
 * resulting XML document is parsed, the parser API will return this text as the original literal
 * string {@code "Foo<Bar>"}.
 *
 * <p>A {@code CharEscaper} instance is required to be stateless, and safe when used concurrently by
 * multiple threads.
 *
 * <p>Popular escapers are defined as constants in classes like {@link
 * com.google.common.html.HtmlEscapers} and {@link com.google.common.xml.XmlEscapers}. To create
 * your own escapers extend this class and implement the {@link #escape(char)} method.
