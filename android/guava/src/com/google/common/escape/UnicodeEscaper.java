/**
 * An {@link Escaper} that converts literal text into a format safe for inclusion in a particular
 * context (such as an XML document). Typically (but not always), the inverse process of
 * "unescaping" the text is performed automatically by the relevant parser.
 *
 * <p>For example, an XML escaper would convert the literal string {@code "Foo<Bar>"} into {@code
 * "Foo&lt;Bar&gt;"} to prevent {@code "<Bar>"} from being confused with an XML tag. When the
 * resulting XML document is parsed, the parser API will return this text as the original literal
 * string {@code "Foo<Bar>"}.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> This class is similar to {@link CharEscaper} but with one very important
 * difference. A CharEscaper can only process Java <a
 * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16">UTF16</a> characters in isolation and may not cope
 * when it encounters surrogate pairs. This class facilitates the correct escaping of all Unicode
 * characters.
 *
 * <p>As there are important reasons, including potential security issues, to handle Unicode
 * correctly if you are considering implementing a new escaper you should favor using UnicodeEscaper
 * wherever possible.
 *
 * <p>A {@code UnicodeEscaper} instance is required to be stateless, and safe when used concurrently
 * by multiple threads.
 *
 * <p>Popular escapers are defined as constants in classes like {@link
 * com.google.common.html.HtmlEscapers} and {@link com.google.common.xml.XmlEscapers}. To create
 * your own escapers extend this class and implement the {@link #escape(int)} method.
