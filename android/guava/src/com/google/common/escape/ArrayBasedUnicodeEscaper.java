/**
 * A {@link UnicodeEscaper} that uses an array to quickly look up replacement characters for a given
 * code point. An additional safe range is provided that determines whether code points without
 * specific replacements are to be considered safe and left unescaped or should be escaped in a
 * general way.
 *
 * <p>A good example of usage of this class is for HTML escaping where the replacement array
 * contains information about the named HTML entities such as {@code &amp;} and {@code &quot;} while
 * {@link #escapeUnsafe} is overridden to handle general escaping of the form {@code &#NNNNN;}.
 *
 * <p>The size of the data structure used by {@link ArrayBasedUnicodeEscaper} is proportional to the
 * highest valued code point that requires escaping. For example a replacement map containing the
 * single character '{@code \}{@code u1000}' will require approximately 16K of memory. If you need
 * to create multiple escaper instances that have the same character replacement mapping consider
 * using {@link ArrayBasedEscaperMap}.
