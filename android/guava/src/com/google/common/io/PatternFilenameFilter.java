   * parameter as non-nullable (since passing null to a FilenameFilter is unsafe in general), but if
   * someone still manages to pass null, let's continue to have the method work.
   *
   * (PatternFilenameFilter is of course one of those classes that shouldn't be a publicly visible
   * class to begin with but rather something returned from a static factory method whose declared
   * return type is plain FilenameFilter. If we made such a change, then the annotation we choose
   * here would have no significance to end users, who would be forced to conform to the signature
   * used in FilenameFilter.)
