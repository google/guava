   * Closes a {@link Closeable}, with control over whether an {@code IOException} may be thrown.

   *
   * <p>If {@code swallowIOException} is true then we never throw {@code IOException} but merely log
   * it.

   * public void useStreamNicely() throws IOException {
   *   SomeStream stream = new SomeStream("foo");
   *   boolean threw = true;
   *   try {

   * @param swallowIOException if true, don't propagate IO exceptions thrown by the {@code close}
   *     methods
   * @throws IOException if {@code swallowIOException} is false and {@code close} throws an {@code
