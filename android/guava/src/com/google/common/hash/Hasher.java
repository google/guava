/**
 * A {@link PrimitiveSink} that can compute a hash code after reading the input. Each hasher should
 * translate all multibyte values ({@link #putInt(int)}, {@link #putLong(long)}, etc) to bytes in
 * little-endian order.
 *
 * <p><b>Warning:</b> The result of calling any methods after calling {@link #hash} is undefined.
 *
 * <p><b>Warning:</b> Using a specific character encoding when hashing a {@link CharSequence} with
 * {@link #putString(CharSequence, Charset)} is generally only useful for cross-language
 * compatibility (otherwise prefer {@link #putUnencodedChars}). However, the character encodings
 * must be identical across languages. Also beware that {@link Charset} definitions may occasionally
 * change between Java releases.
 *
 * <p><b>Warning:</b> Chunks of data that are put into the {@link Hasher} are not delimited. The
 * resulting {@link HashCode} is dependent only on the bytes inserted, and the order in which they
 * were inserted, not how those bytes were chunked into discrete put() operations. For example, the
 * following three expressions all generate colliding hash codes:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * newHasher().putByte(b1).putByte(b2).putByte(b3).hash()
 * newHasher().putByte(b1).putBytes(new byte[] { b2, b3 }).hash()
 * newHasher().putBytes(new byte[] { b1, b2, b3 }).hash()
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>If you wish to avoid this, you should either prepend or append the size of each chunk. Keep in
 * mind that when dealing with char sequences, the encoded form of two concatenated char sequences
 * is not equivalent to the concatenation of their encoded form. Therefore, {@link
 * #putString(CharSequence, Charset)} should only be used consistently with <i>complete</i>
 * sequences and not broken into chunks.
