/**
 * An object which can send data from an object of type {@code T} into a {@code PrimitiveSink}.
 * Implementations for common types can be found in {@link Funnels}.
 *
 * <p>Note that serialization of {@linkplain BloomFilter bloom filters} requires the proper
 * serialization of funnels. When possible, it is recommended that funnels be implemented as a
 * single-element enum to maintain serialization guarantees. See Effective Java (2nd Edition), Item
 * 3: "Enforce the singleton property with a private constructor or an enum type". For example:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public enum PersonFunnel implements Funnel<Person> {
 *   INSTANCE;
 *   public void funnel(Person person, PrimitiveSink into) {
 *     into.putUnencodedChars(person.getFirstName())
 *         .putUnencodedChars(person.getLastName())
 *         .putInt(person.getAge());
 *   }
 * }
 * }</pre>
