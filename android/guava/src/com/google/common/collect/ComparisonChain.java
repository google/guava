/**
 * A utility for performing a chained comparison statement. For example:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * public int compareTo(Foo that) {
 *   return ComparisonChain.start()
 *       .compare(this.aString, that.aString)
 *       .compare(this.anInt, that.anInt)
 *       .compare(this.anEnum, that.anEnum, Ordering.natural().nullsLast())
 *       .result();
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>The value of this expression will have the same sign as the <i>first nonzero</i> comparison
 * result in the chain, or will be zero if every comparison result was zero.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> {@code ComparisonChain} instances are <b>immutable</b>. For this utility to work
 * correctly, calls must be chained as illustrated above.
 *
 * <p>Performance note: Even though the {@code ComparisonChain} caller always invokes its {@code
 * compare} methods unconditionally, the {@code ComparisonChain} implementation stops calling its
 * inputs' {@link Comparable#compareTo compareTo} and {@link Comparator#compare compare} methods as
 * soon as one of them returns a nonzero result. This optimization is typically important only in
 * the presence of expensive {@code compareTo} and {@code compare} implementations.
 *
 * <p>See the Guava User Guide article on <a href=
 * "https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/CommonObjectUtilitiesExplained#comparecompareto">{@code
 * ComparisonChain}</a>.
