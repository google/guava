/**
 * A {@link Multiset} which maintains the ordering of its elements, according to either their
 * natural order or an explicit {@link Comparator}. This order is reflected when iterating over the
 * sorted multiset, either directly, or through its {@code elementSet} or {@code entrySet} views. In
 * all cases, this implementation uses {@link Comparable#compareTo} or {@link Comparator#compare}
 * instead of {@link Object#equals} to determine equivalence of instances.
 *
 * <p><b>Warning:</b> The comparison must be <i>consistent with equals</i> as explained by the
 * {@link Comparable} class specification. Otherwise, the resulting multiset will violate the {@link
 * Collection} contract, which is specified in terms of {@link Object#equals}.
