   *
   * <p>Among the improvements that this method and {@code LoadingCache.get(K)} both provide are:

   * <ul>
   *   <li>{@linkplain LoadingCache#get(Object) awaiting the result of a pending load} rather than
   *       starting a redundant one
   *   <li>eliminating the error-prone caching boilerplate
   *   <li>tracking load {@linkplain #stats statistics}
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>Among the further improvements that {@code LoadingCache} can provide but this method cannot:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>consolidation of the loader logic to {@linkplain CacheBuilder#build(CacheLoader) a single
   *       authoritative location}
   *   <li>{@linkplain LoadingCache#refresh refreshing of entries}, including {@linkplain
   *       CacheBuilder#refreshAfterWrite automated refreshing}
   *   <li>{@linkplain LoadingCache#getAll bulk loading requests}, including {@linkplain
   *       CacheLoader#loadAll bulk loading implementations}
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p><b>Warning:</b> For any given key, every {@code loader} used with it should compute the same
   * value. Otherwise, a call that passes one {@code loader} may return the result of another call
   * with a differently behaving {@code loader}. For example, a call that requests a short timeout
   * for an RPC may wait for a similar call that requests a long timeout, or a call by an
   * unprivileged user may return a resource accessible only to a privileged user making a similar
   * call. To prevent this problem, create a key object that includes all values that affect the
   * result of the query. Or use {@code LoadingCache.get(K)}, which lacks the ability to refer to
   * state other than that in the key.
   *
   * <p><b>Warning:</b> as with {@link CacheLoader#load}, {@code loader} <b>must not</b> return
   * {@code null}; it may either return a non-null value or throw an exception.
   *
   * <p>No observable state associated with this cache is modified until loading completes.
