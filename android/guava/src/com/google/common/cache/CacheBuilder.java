/**
 * A builder of {@link LoadingCache} and {@link Cache} instances.
 *
 * <h2>Prefer <a href="https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/wiki">Caffeine</a> over Guava's caching
 * API</h2>
 *
 * <p>The successor to Guava's caching API is <a
 * href="https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/wiki">Caffeine</a>. Its API is designed to make it a
 * nearly drop-in replacement. Note that it is not available for Android or GWT/J2CL and that it may
 * have <a href="https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/wiki/Guava">different (usually better)
 * behavior</a> when multiple threads attempt concurrent mutations. Its equivalent to {@code
 * CacheBuilder} is its <a
 * href="https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.github.ben-manes.caffeine/caffeine/latest/com.github.benmanes.caffeine/com/github/benmanes/caffeine/cache/Caffeine.html">{@code
 * Caffeine}</a> class. Caffeine offers better performance, more features (including asynchronous
 * loading), and fewer <a
 * href="https://github.com/google/guava/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Apackage%3Dcache+label%3Atype%3Ddefect">bugs</a>.
 *
 * <p>Caffeine defines its own interfaces (<a
 * href="https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.github.ben-manes.caffeine/caffeine/latest/com.github.benmanes.caffeine/com/github/benmanes/caffeine/cache/Cache.html">{@code
 * Cache}</a>, <a
 * href="https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.github.ben-manes.caffeine/caffeine/latest/com.github.benmanes.caffeine/com/github/benmanes/caffeine/cache/LoadingCache.html">{@code
 * LoadingCache}</a>, <a
 * href="https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.github.ben-manes.caffeine/caffeine/latest/com.github.benmanes.caffeine/com/github/benmanes/caffeine/cache/CacheLoader.html">{@code
 * CacheLoader}</a>, etc.), so you can use Caffeine without needing to use any Guava types.
 * Caffeine's types are better than Guava's, especially for <a
 * href="https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.github.ben-manes.caffeine/caffeine/latest/com.github.benmanes.caffeine/com/github/benmanes/caffeine/cache/AsyncLoadingCache.html">their
 * deep support for asynchronous operations</a>. But if you want to migrate to Caffeine with minimal
 * code changes, you can use <a
 * href="https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.github.ben-manes.caffeine/guava/latest/com.github.benmanes.caffeine.guava/com/github/benmanes/caffeine/guava/CaffeinatedGuava.html">its
 * {@code CaffeinatedGuava} adapter class</a>, which lets you build a Guava {@code Cache} or a Guava
 * {@code LoadingCache} backed by a Guava {@code CacheLoader}.
 *
 * <p>Caffeine's API for asynchronous operations uses {@code CompletableFuture}: <a
 * href="https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.github.ben-manes.caffeine/caffeine/latest/com.github.benmanes.caffeine/com/github/benmanes/caffeine/cache/AsyncLoadingCache.html#get(K)">{@code
 * AsyncLoadingCache.get}</a> returns a {@code CompletableFuture}, and implementations of <a
 * href="https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.github.ben-manes.caffeine/caffeine/latest/com.github.benmanes.caffeine/com/github/benmanes/caffeine/cache/AsyncCacheLoader.html#asyncLoad(K,java.util.concurrent.Executor)">{@code
 * AsyncCacheLoader.asyncLoad}</a> must return a {@code CompletableFuture}. Users of Guava's {@link
 * com.google.common.util.concurrent.ListenableFuture} can adapt between the two {@code Future}
 * types by using <a href="https://github.com/lukas-krecan/future-converter#java8-guava">{@code
 * net.javacrumbs.futureconverter.java8guava.FutureConverter}</a>.
 *
 * <h2>More on {@code CacheBuilder}</h2>
 *
 * {@code CacheBuilder} builds caches with any combination of the following features:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>automatic loading of entries into the cache
 *   <li>least-recently-used eviction when a maximum size is exceeded (note that the cache is
 *       divided into segments, each of which does LRU internally)
 *   <li>time-based expiration of entries, measured since last access or last write
 *   <li>keys automatically wrapped in {@code WeakReference}
 *   <li>values automatically wrapped in {@code WeakReference} or {@code SoftReference}
 *   <li>notification of evicted (or otherwise removed) entries
 *   <li>accumulation of cache access statistics
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>These features are all optional; caches can be created using all or none of them. By default,
 * cache instances created by {@code CacheBuilder} will not perform any type of eviction.
 *
 * <p>Usage example:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * LoadingCache<Key, Graph> graphs = CacheBuilder.newBuilder()
 *     .maximumSize(10000)
 *     .expireAfterWrite(Duration.ofMinutes(10))
 *     .removalListener(MY_LISTENER)
 *     .build(
 *         new CacheLoader<Key, Graph>() {
 *           public Graph load(Key key) throws AnyException {
 *             return createExpensiveGraph(key);
 *           }
 *         });
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Or equivalently,
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // In real life this would come from a command-line flag or config file
 * String spec = "maximumSize=10000,expireAfterWrite=10m";
 *
 * LoadingCache<Key, Graph> graphs = CacheBuilder.from(spec)
 *     .removalListener(MY_LISTENER)
 *     .build(
 *         new CacheLoader<Key, Graph>() {
 *           public Graph load(Key key) throws AnyException {
 *             return createExpensiveGraph(key);
 *           }
 *         });
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>The returned cache implements all optional operations of the {@link LoadingCache} and {@link
 * Cache} interfaces. The {@code asMap} view (and its collection views) have <i>weakly consistent
 * iterators</i>. This means that they are safe for concurrent use, but if other threads modify the
 * cache after the iterator is created, it is undefined which of these changes, if any, are
 * reflected in that iterator. These iterators never throw {@link ConcurrentModificationException}.
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> by default, the returned cache uses equality comparisons (the {@link
 * Object#equals equals} method) to determine equality for keys or values. However, if {@link
 * #weakKeys} was specified, the cache uses identity ({@code ==}) comparisons instead for keys.
 * Likewise, if {@link #weakValues} or {@link #softValues} was specified, the cache uses identity
 * comparisons for values.
 *
 * <p>Entries are automatically evicted from the cache when any of {@link #maximumSize(long)
 * maximumSize}, {@link #maximumWeight(long) maximumWeight}, {@link #expireAfterWrite
 * expireAfterWrite}, {@link #expireAfterAccess expireAfterAccess}, {@link #weakKeys weakKeys},
 * {@link #weakValues weakValues}, or {@link #softValues softValues} are requested.
 *
 * <p>If {@link #maximumSize(long) maximumSize} or {@link #maximumWeight(long) maximumWeight} is
 * requested entries may be evicted on each cache modification.
 *
 * <p>If {@link #expireAfterWrite expireAfterWrite} or {@link #expireAfterAccess expireAfterAccess}
 * is requested entries may be evicted on each cache modification, on occasional cache accesses, or
 * on calls to {@link Cache#cleanUp}. Expired entries may be counted by {@link Cache#size}, but will
 * never be visible to read or write operations.
 *
 * <p>If {@link #weakKeys weakKeys}, {@link #weakValues weakValues}, or {@link #softValues
 * softValues} are requested, it is possible for a key or value present in the cache to be reclaimed
 * by the garbage collector. Entries with reclaimed keys or values may be removed from the cache on
 * each cache modification, on occasional cache accesses, or on calls to {@link Cache#cleanUp}; such
 * entries may be counted in {@link Cache#size}, but will never be visible to read or write
 * operations.
 *
 * <p>Certain cache configurations will result in the accrual of periodic maintenance tasks which
 * will be performed during write operations, or during occasional read operations in the absence of
 * writes. The {@link Cache#cleanUp} method of the returned cache will also perform maintenance, but
 * calling it should not be necessary with a high throughput cache. Only caches built with {@link
 * #removalListener removalListener}, {@link #expireAfterWrite expireAfterWrite}, {@link
 * #expireAfterAccess expireAfterAccess}, {@link #weakKeys weakKeys}, {@link #weakValues
 * weakValues}, or {@link #softValues softValues} perform periodic maintenance.
 *
 * <p>The caches produced by {@code CacheBuilder} are serializable, and the deserialized caches
 * retain all the configuration properties of the original cache. Note that the serialized form does
 * <i>not</i> include cache contents, but only configuration.
 *
 * <p>See the Guava User Guide article on <a
 * href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/CachesExplained">caching</a> for a higher-level
 * explanation.
