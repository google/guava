/**
 * {@linkplain CacheBuilder Discouraged} (in favor of <a
 * href="https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/wiki">Caffeine</a>) caching utilities.
 *
 * <p>The core interface used to represent caches is {@link Cache}. In-memory caches can be
 * configured and created using {@link CacheBuilder}, with cache entries being loaded by {@link
 * CacheLoader}. Statistics about cache performance are exposed using {@link CacheStats}.
 *
 * <p>See the Guava User Guide article on <a
 * href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/CachesExplained">caches</a>.
 *
 * <p>This package is a part of the open-source <a href="https://github.com/google/guava">Guava</a>
 * library.
