/**
 * Statistics about the performance of a {@link Cache}. Instances of this class are immutable.
 *
 * <p>Cache statistics are incremented according to the following rules:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>When a cache lookup encounters an existing cache entry {@code hitCount} is incremented.
 *   <li>When a cache lookup first encounters a missing cache entry, a new entry is loaded.
 *       <ul>
 *         <li>After successfully loading an entry {@code missCount} and {@code loadSuccessCount}
 *             are incremented, and the total loading time, in nanoseconds, is added to {@code
 *             totalLoadTime}.
 *         <li>When an exception is thrown while loading an entry, {@code missCount} and {@code
 *             loadExceptionCount} are incremented, and the total loading time, in nanoseconds, is
 *             added to {@code totalLoadTime}.
 *         <li>Cache lookups that encounter a missing cache entry that is still loading will wait
 *             for loading to complete (whether successful or not) and then increment {@code
 *             missCount}.
 *       </ul>
 *   <li>When an entry is evicted from the cache, {@code evictionCount} is incremented.
 *   <li>No stats are modified when a cache entry is invalidated or manually removed.
 *   <li>No stats are modified by operations invoked on the {@linkplain Cache#asMap asMap} view of
 *       the cache.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>A lookup is specifically defined as an invocation of one of the methods {@link
 * LoadingCache#get(Object)}, {@link LoadingCache#getUnchecked(Object)}, {@link Cache#get(Object,
 * Callable)}, or {@link LoadingCache#getAll(Iterable)}.
